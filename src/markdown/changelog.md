## Planned features

#### Main Categories:

- Characters/party
- Session Notes
- World locations
  - Countries
    - Towns
- Plot line formation
- More?

Key features:

- Have it so that any creature / item / magic item when hovered over shows a stat Block
  - if clicked it should expand and show the stat block until it or another is clicked, possibly even a popout window.
- easily relate specific 'pages' to others, ex: if character has a connection to a faction have it click to link to said faction.
- encounter builder including an automated CR calculation that then generates Loot and displays it.

### TODO list

- setup desired layouts for various pages.
- generate a monster population with bootstrapped tiles
- mirror layout for character sheets.
